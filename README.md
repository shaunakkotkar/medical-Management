# Medical Store Management System
In this project I have deployed a Medical Store Management System as a Web App using PHP and MySQL

 # Set Up to run this system in your PC/Laptop :
- Install LAMP on your linux server 
- Start Apache and MySQL 
- Download the codebase as a zip file from this repository and extract the files in the xampp/htdocs folder in your C drive.
- Now open any web browser and visit the url : `localhost/phpmyadmin`
- Create a Database in the MYSQL server as pharmacy and import the `pharmacy.sql` file in the newly created database.
- Now restart mysql.service and check apache.service also  
- while runnig the above url the program will start and the database will be running in the apache server as you can see the differences in the database live!
